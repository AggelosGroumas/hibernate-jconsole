<h2>Hibernate Not Found</h2>

<p>
	The hibernate statistics MBean or the "hibernate3.jar" was not found in this context.
	To resolve this issue, validate that all subsequent requirements are fullfilled:
</p>

<h3>
	1. The Hibernate MBean is published inside the monitored application
</h3>

<p>
	Please ensure that you published the hibernate statistics MBean as
	<code>"Hibernate:application=Statistics"</code> inside the monitored application.<br/>
	<b>Note:</b> Hibernate is not publishing anything by default, it has to be done
	manually using Java code.<br/>
</p>

<p>
	In case of you published the MBean under a different name than the one expected
	by this plugin, use the commandline option <code>"-J-Dhibernate.mbean=OtherName"</code>
	to specify an alternate MBean name.
</p>

<p>
	In case of your monitored application is not yet publishing any hibernate MBeans,
	use the following helper class (contained inside "hibernate-jconsole.jar") to adjust
	your application and enable the JMX support in hibernate:<br/>
	<br/>
	<b>Plain example</b> (Hibernate only):
		<pre><code>MBeanServer myServer = ...;
			SessionFactory sf = ...;
			HibernateJmxBinding jmxBinding = new HibernateJmxBinding(myServer, sf);
			jmxBinding.registerJmxBinding();</code></pre>
<b>Plain example</b> (Hibernate in JPA environment):
		<pre><code>MBeanServer myServer = ...;
			EntityManagerFactory emf = ...;
			JpaHibernateJmxBinding jmxBinding = new JpaHibernateJmxBinding(myServer, emf);
			jmxBinding.registerJmxBinding();</code></pre>
<b>Spring example</b> (annotation config enabled):
		<pre><code>&lt;context:annotation-config/&gt;
			&lt;context:mbean-server id="jmxServer"/&gt;

			&lt;bean class="net.sf.hibernate.jconsole.util.JpaHibernateJmxBinding"/&gt;</code></pre>
</p>

<h3>
	2. Hibernate is within the classpath of JConsole or VisualVm
</h3>

<p>
	The hibernate statistics MBean doesn't use default JMX data types for all statistics.
	As a result the hibernate3.jar must be in the system classpath of JConsole or
	VisualVm to overcome class cast exceptions during the RMI calls.
	<br/>
	Please make sure that one of the following options applies:
<ul>
	<li>JConsole or VisualVm was started from a working directory that contains
		the required JARs in one of the following search paths:
		<code>"./hibernate3.jar"</code>, <code>"lib/hibernate3.jar"</code>
	</li>
	<li>JConsole or VisualVm was started with the commandline option:
		<code>"-J-Dhibernate.classpath=/path/to/folderOrJarFile"</code>
	</li>
	<li>JConsole or VisualVm was started with a tweaked classpath that
		contains the hibernate dependencies already.
	</li>
</ul>
