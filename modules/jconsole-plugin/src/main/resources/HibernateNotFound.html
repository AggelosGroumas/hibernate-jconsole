<h2>Hibernate Not Found</h2>

<p>
	The hibernate statistics MBean or the "hibernate3.jar" was not found in this context.
	To resolve this issue, validate that all subsequent requirements are fulfilled:
</p>

<h3>
	1. The Hibernate MBean is published inside the monitored application
</h3>

<p>
	Please ensure that you published the hibernate statistics MBean as
	<code>"Hibernate:application=Statistics"</code> inside the monitored application.<br/>
	<b>Note:</b> Hibernate is not publishing anything by default, it has to be done
	manually using Java code or by configuring Spring or the used Container.<br/>
</p>

<p>
	In case of you published the MBean under a different name than the one expected
	by this plugin, use the commandline option <code>"-J-Dhibernate.mbean=OtherName"</code>
	to specify an alternate MBean name.
</p>

<p>
	If your monitored application is not yet publishing any hibernate MBeans,
	check that the <a href="http://hibernate-jcons.sourceforge.net/usage.html">prerequisites</a> are fulfilled.
</p>

<h3>
	2. Hibernate is within the classpath of JConsole or VisualVm
</h3>

<p>
	The hibernate statistics MBean doesn't use default JMX data types for some reports.
	As a result the hibernate3.jar must be in the system classpath of JConsole or
	VisualVm to overcome class cast exceptions during the RMI calls.
	<br/>
	Please make sure that <i>one</i> of the following options applies:
<ul>
	<li>
		The monitored application <i>runs locally</i> on the same machine and exposes the
		"hibernate" jars within the classpath that is exposed to monitoring.<br/>
		(Should apply to <i>most locally</i> monitored applications and make them <b>run out of the box</b>).
	</li>
	<li>
		JConsole or VisualVm was started from a working directory that contains
		the required JARs in one of the following search paths:
		<code>"./hibernate3.jar"</code>, <code>"lib/hibernate3.jar"</code>,
		<code>"lib/3rdParty/hibernate3.jar"</code>.<br/>
		(The search path is configurable with <code>"-J-Dhibernate.searchpath=.;lib;lib/3rdParty"</code>)
	</li>
	<li>
		JConsole or VisualVm was started with the commandline option:<br/>
		<code>"-J-Dhibernate.classpath=/path/to/folderOrJarFile"</code><br/>
		With Apache Maven being used, one of the following example paths may be valid:<br/>
		<code>"-J-Dhibernate.classpath=%$USERPROFILE%/.m2/repository/org/hibernate/hibernate-core/3.x/"</code><br/>
		<code>"-J-Dhibernate.classpath=%$USERPROFILE%/.m2/repository/org/hibernate/hibernate/3.x/"</code><br/>
		(substitute <code>%$USERPROFILE%</code> with <code>~</code> on unix)
	</li>
	<li>
		JConsole or VisualVm was started with a tweaked classpath that contains the hibernate dependencies already.
	</li>
</ul>
<b>Note:</b> In most cases the Hibernate versions must match within the classpaths of the monitored
application and JConsole or VisualVM. If there's a version mismatch it's very likely that the serial
version uids will not match between the serialized instances transferred over the JMX connection.
